# tableau sales merap

In this project we do:

👍 Extract our OLTP in SQL SERVER into out data warehouse (Postgres)

👍 Clean and transform the data for visualization purpose

👍 Complex SQL calculation with window functions

👍 Visualize business metrics into Tableau and share

👍 Data refresh in Power BI UI every 15 MINUTES

Tools we use:

ETL: Apache Airflow

Clean and Transform: SQL, Python

Visualization : Tableau

Our achievements:

✍️ Business users now can take actions more frequency base on our metrics, and don't have to wait until the end of day

✍️ Business users can spend more time on sales, marketing instead of reporting, less manual work and more productivity

This is a On-Going Project so we need to modify more based on the users
